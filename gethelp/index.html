<h1>Get Help!</h1>
<p>Everyone needs a little help sometimes, from n00bs to veteran Java programmers.  Keep reading below to find out where you can get help using the OpenShift Java Client, and contributing to this awesome project.</p>

<h3>Where can I chat in real time with people about the OpenShift Java Client?</h3>
<p>Excellent question!  If you want to chat in real time with people about this library, whether it is questions about using it in your own applications, or how you can contribute to this project, then you should join one (or both) of the following channels on Freenode IRC.
    <ul>
        <li>Join the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=openshift-dev&uio=d4" target="_blank">#openshift-dev channel</a> on the irc.freenode.net IRC server</li>
    <li>Join the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=jbosstools&uio=d4" target="_blank">#jbosstools channel</a> on the irc.freenode.net IRC server</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Where can I file bug reports, feature requests, and track the status of the project?</h3>
<p>The best way to file bug reports, feature requests, and generally keep up to date on the project is to create an account at <a href="" target="_blank">JBoss.org</a> and then check out the <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSJC" target="_blank">OpenShift Java Client Project</a>.  This is especially important if you plan on becoming a <a href="../joinus">contributor</a>.</p>

<h3>Where can I ask questions and get responses while I work on something else?</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to reach a larger audience with your question in hopes of receiving responses from experts in different technologies, have people vote your question up or down, and let the community decide what the best answer to your question is.  Does this sound familiar? It should.  <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a> to the rescue!</p>
<p>Sign up for an account at stackoverflow and post your question!  Make sure that you add the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/openshift" target="_blank">openshift tag</a>, which is monitored by contributors to this project, along with many other projects that have to do with OpenShift, and any other tags that you feel are appropriate to get your question in front of the people that will be able to help you out.</p>

<h3>I'm old school, is there a mailing list?</h3>
<p>Of course there is a mailing list!  You can join the <a href="https://lists.openshift.redhat.com/openshiftmm/listinfo/dev" target="_blank">OpenShift Developer Mailing List</a> to post questions, help answer others questions, and keep up to date on what is going on with OpenShift and it's associated tools and sub-projects.  This mailing list is not specific to the OpenShift Java Client, but there are contributors subscribed to it.</p>
